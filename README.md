# CorporaciÃ³n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting
This project focuses on building time series models to forecast item-level sales for CorporaciÃ³n Favorita grocery stores across Ecuador. Accurate sales forecasting helps optimize inventory management, prevent stockouts, and enhance promotional strategies.

## Objective
The primary goal is to predict future sales of items sold in different store locations using historical sales data. Reliable forecasts support better decision-making for stock, logistics, and business planning.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: Kaggle Competition - [CorporaciÃ³n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data)

Download Method: Via Kaggle API script (kaggle competitions download)

Please include a folder with all the csv data named data and 

The dataset includes:
| Dataset | Description    |
| :-------- | :------- |
| train.csv:| Daily item-level sales (unit_sales) per store. Includes onpromotion. Only non-zero sales are recorded. Negative values indicate returns.|
| stores.csv:| city, state, type, and cluster.|
| items.csv: | Item metadata â€“ family, class, and perishable. Perishable items have a score weight of 1.25; others, 1.0.|
| transactions.csv:| Number of transactions per store/date (training period only).|
| oil.csv: | Daily oil prices. Important due to Ecuador's oil-driven economy.|
| holidays_events.csv: | National/local holidays and special events, including transferred, bridge, workday, and additional holiday types.|
